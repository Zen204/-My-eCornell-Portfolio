Unit 5: Evaluate and Deploy Your Model
This unit advances students into the evaluation and deployment phases of the machine learning lifecycle.
Students learn to assess a model's ability to generalize to new data through various out-of-sample validation
techniques. Students explore different methods to enhance model performance, including the optimization
of hyperparameters and feature selection, using their own implementations along with the built-in capabilities
of scikit-learn.
Students then transition to the deployment of machine learning models and how to make models operational
and available to stakeholders to address real business challenges. This includes discussions on deployment
strategies and the ongoing monitoring of models once they are in production. This unit is designed to provide
students with a comprehensive understanding of how to not only develop but also effectively deploy and
manage machine learning models.
Unit 5 Objectives:
1. Understand the importance of model selection in machine learning
2. Choose model evaluation metrics that are appropriate for the application

This unit equips students with the essential skills and theoretical knowledge needed to apply neural networks
and deep learning techniques effectively. Students begin this unit by exploring the foundational principles of
neural networks. Students are then introduced to the architecture of traditional feedforward neural networks
and are guided through the process of constructing and training these networks using Keras.
The instruction will then extend to deep learning. Students explore applications of deep learning in fields
such as natural language processing and computer vision, highlighting the effectiveness of different neural
network architectures like convolutional neural networks in these areas. The unit’s exercises allow students to
implement a convolutional neural network for image classification tasks.

Unit 8: Special Topics: Natural Language Processing
In this unit, students explore Natural Language Processing (NLP). The unit covers the NLP pipeline, beginning
with preprocessing and transforming text into numerical features. Students explore various techniques
integral to this initial step and the subsequent stages of the NLP pipeline for effective text data processing.
Students then dive into the utilization of neural network models. They will gain hands-on experience by
implementing a neural network tailored to address an NLP challenge, enhancing their practical skills in
applying complex machine learning models.
This unit’s lab emphasizes proper problem formulation and bias mitigation. They will select from three
datasets previously introduced in the course, preparing and employing these datasets to articulate and solve
a specific machine learning problem. Each student will draft a comprehensive project plan that outlines their
approach to model fitting, evaluation, and iterative improvement, consolidating their learning and preparing
them to tackle real-world NLP problems.
