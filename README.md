This is a Machine Learning project focusing on logistic regression model selection and evaluation.
The following tasks were completed in the implementation of this project:

1. Build DataFrame and Define the ML Problem
-Load the Data Set: Load the Airbnb "listings" data set.
Define the Label: Specify what is being predicted.
Identify the Features: Determine which features will be used for prediction.
2. Create Labeled Examples from the Data Set
-Prepare the data set to create labeled examples suitable for model training and evaluation.
3. Split the Data into Training and Test Data Sets
-Divide the data set into training and testing subsets to ensure robust model evaluation.
4. Train, Test, and Evaluate a Logistic Regression (LR) Model
-Use the scikit-learn default value for hyperparameter ùê∂ to train, test, and evaluate the initial logistic regression model.
5. Perform a Grid Search to Identify the Optimal Value of ùê∂ 
-Conduct a grid search to find the best value for the hyperparameter ùê∂
in the logistic regression model.
6. Train, Test, and Evaluate a Logistic Regression Model Using the Optimal Value of ùê∂
-Utilize the optimal value of ùê∂ obtained from the grid search to train, test, and evaluate a refined logistic regression model.
7. Plot a Precision-Recall Curve for Both Models
-Generate and plot precision-recall curves for the initial and optimized logistic regression models.
8. Plot the ROC and Compute the AUC for Both Models
-To assess their performance, Create ROC plots and compute the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for both models.
9. Perform Feature Selection
-Identify and select the most important features to enhance model performance and interpretability.
10. Make the Model Persistent for Future Use
-Save the trained model to ensure it can be reused and deployed.
This structured approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of logistic regression models, from initial training and testing to hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, ultimately leading to a robust and interpretable model for the given classification problem.
